          That's the usual answer we would give when someone asks us why we do what we do. There are many benefits to scuba diving. One, it makes you happy, by improving your mental and emotional well-being & helps relieve stress. Secondly, who doesn't like the beach? Imagine being surrounded by crystal clear sea, the sun kissing your skin & sand between your toes. Being a diver, you will travel and explore places you've never heard of, and return home full of wonderful stories & adventures to share. Marvel at the beauty of nature, enjoy the peace & quiet the underwater world brings.

          And the best part of it all, you will definitely make new friends, expand your network & share your stories and experiences. And that's how we (Marine Monkees) got started. Have fun exploring our site, or if you need more information feel free to contact us anytime!
